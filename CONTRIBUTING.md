This section is for if you want to run the package and reusable components in development, and get involved by making a code contribution.

> Requirements: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to easily handle scripts and virtual environments, docker to deploy qdrant and the server

## üì•Ô∏è Clone

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-llm
cd sparql-llm
```

## ‚òëÔ∏è Run tests

Make sure the existing tests still work by running the test suite and linting checks. Note that any pull requests to the fairworkflows repository on github will automatically trigger running of the test suite;

```bash
uv run pytest
```

To display all logs when debugging:

```bash
uv run pytest -s
```

## üßπ Format code

```bash
uvx ruff format
uvx ruff check --fix
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Run the server

Checkout the `README.md` for instructions to run the server in development with docker.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reset the environment

Upgrade `uv`:

```sh
uv self update
```

Clean `uv` cache:

```sh
uv cache clean
```

## üè∑Ô∏è New release process

Get a PyPI API token at [pypi.org/manage/account](https://pypi.org/manage/account).

1. Increment the `version` number in the `pyproject.toml` file.

   ```bash
   uvx hatch version fix
   ```

2. Build and publish:

   ```bash
   uv build
   uv publish
   ```

> If `uv publish` is still broken:
>
> ```sh
> uvx hatch build
> uvx hatch publish
> ```
